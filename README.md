# DEPRECATED

- The FreeSewing core library now allows plugins to provide their own packing implemntation.
- The `@freesewing/plugin-bin-pack` package provides the default packing that was previously in core
- That plugin is part of the core plugins

So everything works as before, but you can now (if you want) override the packing method.

This package/repo is deprecated and should not be used.
